## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- SCSS using prepros

### What I learned

I am not sure there was much of learning outcome here, the project itself is not challenging to implement. The challenge was working with SCSS itself, its too much to handle for me.
